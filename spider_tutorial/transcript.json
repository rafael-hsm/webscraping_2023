{"title": "Blame It on Rio (1984) - full transcript", "plot": "Matthew is married to Karen, and father to teenaged daughter, Nikki. Victor, his colleague and best friend, who is going through a divorce, is father to 17-year-old Jennifer. Matthew's marriage is not going well as well. Just before they are to embark for a trip to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Karen says she is going on vacation by herself to \"think about everything.\" Matthew and Victor decide to go to Rio with their daughters. The magical atmosphere of Rio, as if saturated with eroticism and languid lusts, takes them by surprise. Victor hunts for every woman, and Matthew, faithful to his wife, modestly accompanies his daughter in her entertainment. But the exciting Brazilian rhythms and frank dances on the moonlit beach do their job. Unable to resist the relentless onslaught of the young seducer, Matthew enters into an intimate relationship with her. Victor is furious when he finds out about an \"older man\" in his daughter's life, and sets out to hunt him down with the aid of Matthew.", "transcript": ["Might've been", "the free and easy laughter", "in the air", "might've been", "the moonlight on the sea", "might've been", "the warm and friendly", "feeling everywhere", "but something wild", "came over you and me", "and we felt", "our inhibitions", "melt away the snow", "though we tried to fight it,", "you and I", "just about the time", "discretion", "should have said hello", "we watched our good", "intentions wave goodbye", "what if we both went", "a little bit crazy?", "Blame it on Rio", "what if our hearts", "got a little bit hazy?", "Blame it on Rio", "what if we", "acted like fools", "broke a few rules?", "What do we care?", "Blame it on Rio", "what if we both went", "a little bit crazy?", "Blame it on Rio", "what if our hearts", "got a little bit hazy?", "Blame it on Rio", "what if we acted", "like fools", "broke a few rules?", "What do we care?", "Blame it on Rio", "Rio de Janeiro", "bum bum bum bum", "bum bum bum", "la da da da", "da da da", "bum bum bum bum?", "What happened happened.", "You just never know.", "One time,", "the company I work for", "transferred me to an island", "in the pacific.", "Fantastic place.", "I invited my girl", "To visit me.", "I sent her a postcard", "every day", "with a single word", "on each card.", "I wrote...", "\"found a virgin paradise...", "\"it's yours-Matthew.\"", "Naturally, they were delivered", "in the wrong order.", "The message she got was...", "\"found a virgin.", "\"It's paradise.", "Yours, Matthew.\"", "I never heard", "from her again.", "Vacations", "are full of surprises,", "to say nothing of virgins,", "which brings me", "to last year.", "It had been", "a really mixed-up time.", "Just when I got to wear", "a smaller retainer,", "my parents filed", "for divorce.", "Kinda took the fun", "out of smiling.", "I'd been working in brazil", "out of Sao Paulo,", "the new york of brazil.", "Sao Paulo is where", "all the work gets done.", "Where all the fun gets done", "is in Rio,", "which is where", "my wife Karen and I", "decided to spend", "our last vacation.", "Somehow", "I'd never made it there-", "by all accounts,", "the most exciting, the most", "sensuous city in the world.", "I didn't know", "if this was actually true,", "but after 20 years", "of marriage,", "any fantasy helps.", "Victor was coming along,", "of course.", "That's my friend", "Victor Lyons.", "He was going through", "a bad patch at the time.", "This divorce", "is gonna kill me.", "Phone calls, letters.", "Iook at this.", "From her lawyers.", "Every day something.", "If I don't get a letter,", "I get a telegram.", "We're in more contact", "apart", "than we ever were", "together.", "Who knows, maybe the divorce", "will save the marriage.", "Bite your tongue.", "Just one day", "in Rio,", "you'll forget", "all about it.", "I promise you.", "Tell you the truth,", "if it wasn't for Jennifer,", "I wouldn't even go.", "I don't have to leave town", "to be miserable.", "It's much cheaper", "doing it at home.", "When does she get in?", "She's on a 3:00 flight.", "Imagine what all this", "is doing to the kid.", "She'll be all right.", "Kids are survivors.", "Pays to survive, huh?", "Half.", "That's all she wants.", "Wish I had herpes.", "I say to myself", "she likes 'em", "handsome and tall", "I had to admit", "that I'm not", "like that at all", "I still don't know what", "drew her to me overnight?", "Jennifer!", "Hi.", "Let me", "look at you.", "You-you're", "gorgeous.", "So are you.", "Yeah.", "Well, what happened?", "You're almost a woman.", "I'm strong, too, daddy.", "I won't break.", "Oh, yeah.", "Right.

{"title": "Arena (1989) - full transcript", "plot": "Steve Armstrong is a human short-order cook in a fast food restaurant on a \"starstation\" where the most popular arena fighting tournament in the whole galaxy is held. Members of various alien species fight one on one, often dirty, to become the ruling champions of the galaxy. The restaurant's sole waiter and Steve's boss is Shorty, a short four-armed scheming humanoid alien. When Steve saves Shorty from a particularly unpleasant and violent alien guest, they're both fired by the restaurant's automated A.I. for brawling. Shorty shows gratitude and they become friends. However, without jobs, they'll both be kicked off the space station. Thankfully, Quinn, a human female no-nonsense fighting promoter, who's in quick need of new fighters, hears about Steve's fight with the alien guest and offers him sponsorship. Human fighters have traditionally been defeated easily by naturally tougher alien fighters in previous tournaments and Steve would be a real underdog. Shorty manages to convince Steve to take the offer and after some initial difficulties, Steve proves to be a really tough fighter with an actual tiny chance of success. In the eyes of humans all across the galaxy, who feel inferior to the various alien races, Steve becomes their idol and champion of humanity. Steve doesn't really want all this attention, but he understands the hope people put in him. Rogor is the tournament's crooked organizer, who's complete control over the competition and the players is shaken by Steve's surprising success. He offers one of his deals to Steve as well, but he refuses. Rogor then comes up with a plan to get rid of Steve for good, if he gets to the finals. Rogor's rat-faced yesman Weezil is eager to help. Meanwhile, beautiful Jade attracts Steve's attention.", "transcript": ["Announcer: ...comes back with a biting right hook.", "Spinner's hurt. He staggers back.

{"title": "Vostochny koridor (1967) - full transcript", "plot": "Philosophical parable \"Eastern Corridor\" was created during the decline of the \"thaw\", when Soviet artists were, though metered and censored, but still \"a breath of freedom.\" As the film industry (as, indeed, and other production) in 1960s is entirely owned by the state, the question of commercial profit from the rental of films, although on the agenda, but was not completely dominant. There was a so-called state orders on important topics of state ideology, such as a revolutionary, military, historical, biographical, etc. It is logical that within the framework of military subjects were allowed not only action-picture type of spy ware detective but also films that were not originally designed for a mass audience, but significant for the annual \"plan.\" Thus, there is no doubt that the \"Eastern Corridor\" was in the thematic focus of the studio \"Belarus-film\" based on usual partisan drum section telling about the heroism of Soviet people during the occupation. Eventually, the film was not the way it was waiting to see the boss, and was greeted with hostility not only to party officials, but quite liberal critics. So it is only surprising that after spending two years on the shelf, the film \"Eastern Corridor\" still left in the so-called \"limited release\" in 1968 ... This film could be the hit for any Western Festival of the late 1960s (as much a triumph as \"The Cranes Are Flying\" and \"Ivan's Childhood.\"), but, alas ... After the \"Eastern Corridor\" creative life of Valentin Vinogradov obviously did not work.

{"title": "Wyrok zycia (1933) - full transcript", "plot": "The following is the story of the film, summarized chronologically. The film actually begins in the middle of the story, with the murder prosecution and conviction of Jadzia (Andrzejewska). She then tells her appellate attorney Krystyna what happened:Jadzia is a poor, lonely government worker in Warsaw who lives in a rooming house and studies at night with ambitions of becoming a nurse. On what is supposed to be a day trip to the countryside with her office mates, she is seduced and abandoned by a stranger named Janusz (Damiecki) whose face is not shown. Distressed over her being abandoned, Jadzia becomes distracted at work and is fired for making too many mistakes. She cannot hold down a job due to fainting spells which, it turns out, are due to pregnancy. She is evicted from the rooming house and becomes homeless. While weeping with her infant son at the river's side, his basket cradle accidentally drops into the river. Jadzia calls for help, but it is too late, and those who respond to her cries for help accuse her of murder. She is charged with murder under Article 25, Section 1 of Poland's Penal Code. A court-appointed lawyer defends her, but he is not very effective, so she is convicted and sentenced to death. The trial scene opens with the testimony of the one of the women who was nearby when Jadzia's infant son fell into the river. She stands, facing the panel of three judges, and the presiding judge in the middle asks her whether she confirms her previous written statement. The presiding judge wears the distinctive chain and medallion of Poland's coat of arms, which is a White Eagle. The coat of arms is also displayed prominently on wall behind presiding judge. A large crucifix rests on the bench near the presiding judge. The traditional bell for calling the court to order is resting next to the crucifix, but in this film the presiding judge is never shown using it, not even when the panel emerges to pronounce the verdict and sentence. After the witness affirms her written statement, the presiding judge confirms that neither of the other two judges has a question and then dismisses the witness. The testimony is heard by twelve jurors, all male, who sit in a separate jury box to the right hand of the panel of judges. The presiding judge then asks the prosecutor, who sits at the right end of the bench, near the jury box, to give his summation. Before speaking, the prosecutor stands and dons his cap. When he is through speaking, he removes the cap. The defendant sits in a dock to the left, across from the jury. As is customary in civil law countries, defense counsel speaks last. His client Jadzia sits behind him, guarded. There is a crucifix hanging on the wall behind them. During defense counsels plea, the film cuts abruptly to the judges returning to the bench to pronounce the verdict of the jury and to pronounce sentence. The abrupt cut implies that the deliberation was done quickly. All three judges remain standing as the presiding judge pronounces the guilty verdict and the death sentence. Incidentally, a female attorney Krystyna (Eichlerówna) is watching the proceedings from the gallery and believes that Jadzia has been convicted in error, so she volunteers to handle the appeal to the court of second instance. An appeal in civil law courts is essentially a re-trial. However, what is depicted in Life Sentence is more likely a new trial and not an appeal, because a 12-man jury is empaneled, and evidence and argument are once again presented to a three-judge panel. We are shown only the layout of the court and a glimpse of Krystynas impassioned plea to the jury.Cut to Krystynas informing Jadzia that she has been acquitted. Without consulting with her husband Janusz, Krystyna takes Jadzia home to stay indefinitely, providing her with her own room and a bank account. Jadzia and Janusz meet, and Krystyna learns that her husband is the cad who seduced and abandoned Jadzia. Janusz shoots himself in the head and survives, and Krystyna forgives him. We are left to speculate about Jadzia's future.", "transcript": ["Film Production Company", "presents", "LIFE SENTENCE", "Who is Guilty?", "Written by", "Directed by", "Photographed by", "Art Manager", "Production Manager", "Set Decorator", "Music", "Songs", "Produced by", "LIFE SENTENCE", "Who is Guilty?", "So the witness confirms", "her testimony?", "Yes, Your Honor.", "I remember well.", "There were three of us.", "We were doing laundry by the river.", "I saw it with my own eyes.", "The witness may go now.", "I've never been a juror before.", "Me, I am always selected.", "And forgive us our debts,", "as we also have forgiven our debtors.", "Let's hear the prosecution now.", "Your Honor,", "members of the jury.", "We are gathered here today", "to take into our hands", "yet another case.", "One of those", "society is too lenient with.", "But you, members of the jury,", "must not be guided by false mercy.", "That woman has killed.", "Killed her own child.", "Motherhood is", "the superior mission of a woman...", "The halo of sanctity over her head.", "Twins!", "Oh, God.
